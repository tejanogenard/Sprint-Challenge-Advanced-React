- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    Class components gave us the ability to use state before hooks were added functions 
    "functional stateless components" could not hold any state

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    we use the componentDidMount() method to "mount" our inital
    data inside our constructor. 

    with the setState() Function this allows us update our state

    The last lifecycle method we use to "unmount" our component is 
    the componentWillUnmount() method. 


- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    A custom hook allows resuablility within our code so that any time 
    we have to repeat a similar process we do not have to recode it.


- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
    “We write tests to give us confidence in the code we are shipping to production!”
